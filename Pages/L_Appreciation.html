            Hi Beautiful, I just wanna start this off with thank you. Thanks for: <br>
            <ul>
                <li>being there through thick and thin,</li>
                <li>being the pillar of support I never knew I needed,</li>
                <li>driving me to be better in every way,</li>
                <li>being a shoulder to lean on for the tough times,</li>
                <li>listening to my ramblings and smiling,</li>
                <li>making me feel valuable,</li>
                <li>accepting me and my values regardless of its alignment with yours,</li>
                <li>not judging and understanding my point of views,</li>
                <li>making me feel heard and seen,</li>
                <li>creating unforgettable memories with me,</li>
                <li>and countless more.</li>
            </ul>

            I could have kept going but I'll just say that I'm so grateful that not only are you in my life,
            but you chose to stay with me despite all my downfalls. There are objectively better people out 
            there but for some reason you stick around with me. Not only that, you have decided to do this forever.
            If you ask me, you're pretty crazy for deciding to dedicate yourself to someone like me so early into 
            the relationship. I was scared of how you would be with me if you found out more about me, so I kept a 
            relative distance. If I had all-ined and things didn't work out, I would have been hurt badly so forgive me
             there. But you seemed so adamant about me despite not knowing that much at first. Despite this, your dedication 
             and affection swayed and was so infectious. I am thankful for you unwavering thoughts and feelings for me.
             Before meeting you, my self-esteem and mental capabilities were low. It was something I was working towards as my 
             self body image was improving. However, I had long disregarded mental health as being a potential factor for me,
             as I always gaslighted myself into thinking that I'm just being dramatic. Thanks to you, not only as my self-esteem
             started improving, I'm working towards creating a stronger affinity for preservation of the mental mind. 
             You have helped me see more clearly in life and opened my mind into many possiblities and thought processes I didn't 
             know existed.
