        <p>
            Hey Gorgeous, did you know I actually only see you? Thanks to that, I've noticed alot of things about you.
            Things that would go unnoticed by many, but I see them. I see how you are so disturbing selfless. I have never
            seen a person that puts their friends over themselves in basically all situations. They write songs about catching 
            grenades for others but I have no doubt in my mind that you would not hesitate to do so yourself. To witness such
            a caring and loving person in all their shapes and forms, I've only fallen further and further for you and everything
            associated with you. 
        </p>
