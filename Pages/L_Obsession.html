        <h1>Letter of Obsession</h1>
        <p>
            Man... there's something about you that just hits right. You got something that got me entranced like this
            and I don't know what it is. Is your beautiful smile? Those lucious lips? Amazing personality? I feel like its
            probably the combination of everything that make such a perfect person. I've never been this way about anything.
            I've never been so obsessed with someone/something like this before. It's kinda scary but at the same time, I
            just cant help it. You were worried about me losing love/interest with you over time but I think you are
            insane because these feelings are only getting stronger and stronger each day. I spend nearly every moment thinking
            about you. Probably because I imagine our lives together and how I want to do literally everything together.
            I want to wake up together, eat together, shower together, live together, sleep together, and more. Now that I'm in 
            Vietnam without you, everything feels hollow. To be honest, I nearly cried alot when I was at the airport. 
            Every step I took was every step away from you. It was excrusiating and unbearable but it was inevitable. 
            Sitting on the plane, I tried with every fibre of my body to keep normal but I just faced forward with tears rolling
            down my eyes. You have infested my mind and turned me from a self-reliant nobody to a person that has 
            become reliant on your existence to keep going each day. You have given me motiviation in the actions I do.
            The reason I kept going with my job till the end was to have some money to spend on you for whatever you wanted.
            The reason I drive so much was to make sure my bby doesn't get tired. The reason I let you into my household often is
            because I know you want to be somewhere else besides home and I want to be the one to provide you that. Whenever
            my phone lights up, I always quickly check to see if it's you. I want to do everything with you. That's why I want
            to start learning how to swim and boulder. I want to do things more with you as seeing you happy brings me the 
            most joy. I want to know more about you. I just straight up want you. Every day in Vietnam without the possibility of seeing 
            you is hollow as hell. While I have accepted that these are the circumstances, I still miss you everyday and dream 
            about you everynight. I love you baby and that feeling only grows more and more each day.
