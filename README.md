Hey bby,<br>
This is a project I'm creating to not only improve my skills in HTML and CSS (maybe JavaScript), but to also show my love for you. I want to be able to be better as a 
programmer in general for you. I want to aid you in creating software to help you in your teaching journey. I will work hard for both our sakes. I love you and will
show you how to use and modify the website as well in time with a guide on GitHub. For now, I need to know more myself so I can teach you later down the line.<br>
I love you, Thanh Phan and that will never change or falter. <br>
